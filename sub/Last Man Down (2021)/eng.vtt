WEBVTT

00:58.433 --> 00:59.768
Hey!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.285
John.

01:16.869 --> 01:19.580
The town of Westberg
had 5,000 people.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.293
3,000 die from the virus.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.422
1,500 of the infected
was taken care of.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.090
So you do the math, yeah?

01:31.216 --> 01:32.259
That's 500 missing.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.762
500 potential
contagious bearers.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.056
The town was clean.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.976
I don't care
about your opinion

01:41.518 --> 01:43.061
but I do care about facts

01:43.979 --> 01:47.357
and I'm gonna give you
the chance to share some with me.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.402
Tell me where
the townfolks went.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.239
John?

01:54.740 --> 01:56.074
I'm gonna count to 10.

02:00.662 --> 02:01.663
One.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.832
I don't know where they are.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.083
Two.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.755
Three.

02:10.756 --> 02:11.798
Four.

02:11.924 --> 02:12.966
Let her go.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.093
Let her go.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.805
Five.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.808
Six.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.269
I don't know.

02:24.853 --> 02:25.896
I don't know!

02:26.688 --> 02:28.857
They all left by the time
my squad got there.

02:29.983 --> 02:30.984
Seven.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.529
She's got nothing to do with this.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.405
You're really gonna
sacrifice your wife

02:35.489 --> 02:37.032
for a bunch of strangers?

02:40.118 --> 02:41.161
Eight.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.414
Nine.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.416
Kill me instead.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.256
I beg you.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.799
Kill you?

02:54.633 --> 02:55.759
Please stop this.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.595
The time
for heroes is over, John.

03:01.765 --> 03:02.891
Remember.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.434
Look at me.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.773
Look at me!

03:11.191 --> 03:13.694
I love you, I love you!

03:17.573 --> 03:18.740
You chose this.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.291
You chose this!

03:35.841 --> 03:37.342
I don't know where they are!

03:41.388 --> 03:43.265
No!

06:54.331 --> 06:55.415
Get down.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.449
Stop!

07:29.533 --> 07:30.576
Leave them alone!

07:33.662 --> 07:34.705
Stop!

07:34.872 --> 07:35.956
They're innocent.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.675
Traitor!

08:02.774 --> 08:04.401
<i>Remember.</i>

08:05.777 --> 08:07.529
<i>Please stop this.</i>

08:14.786 --> 08:17.122
<i>You're really gonna
sacrifice your wife?</i>

08:17.915 --> 08:19.041
<i>Let her go.</i>

08:24.087 --> 08:25.380
<i>You chose this.</i>

08:42.563 --> 08:44.358
Your wife was infected, John.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.193
She had to die.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.611
And you know the rule

08:48.237 --> 08:49.613
we cannot let one person

08:49.696 --> 08:51.907
be responsible
for a million dead people.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.159
She was not infected.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.786
She wasn't?

08:56.161 --> 08:57.454
You could've tested her.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.456
Oh, we did, John. We did.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.876
But I always found those
things highly unreliable.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.796
I'd rather trust my gut,
or as they say

09:06.338 --> 09:07.756
stay on the safe side.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.634
How many innocents
are you gonna kill

09:10.717 --> 09:11.927
for the common good?

09:12.010 --> 09:13.303
Innocent?

09:13.554 --> 09:14.972
Don't change the subject.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.266
Are you at least not
a bit interested

09:17.349 --> 09:18.684
in what's in store for you?

09:19.351 --> 09:20.394
No.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.478
No?

09:22.187 --> 09:25.983
You're immune, John,
and we want to find out how.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.610
So maybe you'll get
the chance to save

09:28.694 --> 09:30.279
some more lives after all.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.294
Cheer up, little boy.

09:45.711 --> 09:49.798
If this was Lapland,
you'd be boiled in a sauna

09:49.882 --> 09:51.383
and thrown into a frozen lake

09:51.800 --> 09:53.677
until the skin came off
your bones.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.180
Now you're only getting
pin pricks.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.726
The only prick around here
is you.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.144
Fuck you.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.313
Save your jokes, comedian.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.607
You might be needing them later.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.474
Seal the ship.

11:22.558 --> 11:23.892
Seal the ship! Seal the ship!

11:47.541 --> 11:50.085
<i>Contagion subject 5788</i>

11:50.169 --> 11:52.671
<i>is loose on the vessel,
apprehend on sight.</i>

11:54.047 --> 11:57.384
<i>Contagion subject 5788
is loose on the vessel...</i>

11:57.467 --> 11:59.219
Buckle up, boys. Take him alive.

11:59.344 --> 12:02.389
My name is John Wood.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.851
So you've made it this far?

12:08.687 --> 12:10.022
Hey, asshole!

12:11.773 --> 12:13.400
Get over here,
you little fucker.

12:14.526 --> 12:15.777
Goodnight!

12:51.647 --> 12:52.731
Please.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.652
Help me.

12:57.694 --> 12:58.820
Hide me.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.357
It's OK.

14:28.202 --> 14:29.620
I'm not going to hurt you.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.095
Your wound is infected.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.644
We have to remove the bullet.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.671
It's for your own good.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.260
Drink it.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.318
That's why it's gonna hurt.

16:45.214 --> 16:46.298
Wait.

16:48.592 --> 16:49.635
What's your name?

16:50.886 --> 16:52.012
John.

16:53.639 --> 16:54.806
Are you a doctor, John?

16:59.311 --> 17:00.437
No.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.233
Aren't you gonna ask my name?

17:13.450 --> 17:14.535
Maria.

17:19.373 --> 17:23.377
<i>Porca Puttana cazzo Madonna.</i>

17:24.211 --> 17:25.420
<i>Che cazzo!</i>

17:38.016 --> 17:39.226
Military grade.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.062
Who's after you?

17:43.355 --> 17:44.690
And how did you get here?

18:32.279 --> 18:34.281
You can stay here for a few days

18:35.574 --> 18:37.034
then you have to leave.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.371
I don't want to have
any problems.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.665
I want to live in peace.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.994
Give me the axe.

20:05.289 --> 20:06.373
You need to rest.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.301
Nice clothes.

20:18.552 --> 20:19.511
Keep them.

20:19.803 --> 20:20.888
I will!

21:11.730 --> 21:12.898
Hey, timber man.

21:14.608 --> 21:15.817
We're looking for a girl.

21:16.610 --> 21:18.070
You have anyone pass through?

21:24.868 --> 21:25.911
Oi!

21:26.078 --> 21:27.120
I'm talking to you.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.373
Have you seen a girl?

21:29.915 --> 21:30.999
She's a threat.

21:32.626 --> 21:33.669
Infected.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.089
With the virus, you know.

21:40.092 --> 21:42.427
You're the first fucks
I've seen in ages.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.472
Since the virus, you know.

21:48.267 --> 21:49.434
Search the place.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.281
I found it under the mattress.

22:47.326 --> 22:48.410
I know.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.731
That's some guns.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.576
You're not just a random
timber man...

23:31.328 --> 23:32.412
are you?

23:42.923 --> 23:44.591
I like to prepare for war...

23:47.469 --> 23:48.637
and pray for peace.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.306
A riddle?

23:58.313 --> 24:00.274
You're the only mystery
around here.

24:04.945 --> 24:05.988
So, what's next?

24:07.990 --> 24:10.534
You tell me.
You're the one they're after.

24:11.076 --> 24:12.244
I can help.

24:21.336 --> 24:22.379
Start with this.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.715
You made a bloody mess.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.231
Ow!

24:58.749 --> 24:59.875
Hmm.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.882
The mercenaries should
have been back by now.

25:07.007 --> 25:08.842
Yes, they're dead.

25:09.259 --> 25:11.053
Oh, what makes you so sure?

25:11.887 --> 25:14.681
Well, they're not at a Sunday
school reunion, are they?

25:15.891 --> 25:19.353
I'd be surprised if these... guys

25:19.853 --> 25:21.396
even finished kindergarten.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.565
They're only ever good
for two things

25:23.899 --> 25:26.818
affordability and disposability.

25:27.486 --> 25:29.196
So we send another squad?

25:30.364 --> 25:31.406
Yes.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.951
And wait with reporting
to Commander Stone

25:34.576 --> 25:36.453
until we know what's going on.

25:43.377 --> 25:44.545
Break it up!

25:51.134 --> 25:52.886
Attack me, come on.

25:57.683 --> 26:00.102
Your best move, now.

26:05.983 --> 26:07.025
Come on!

26:24.585 --> 26:25.669
Stop!

26:31.800 --> 26:33.218
What the hell are you doing?

26:33.927 --> 26:34.887
Your job.

26:35.095 --> 26:38.724
I'm supposed to train them,
not kill them.

26:39.224 --> 26:41.310
Then step your fucking game up.

26:46.481 --> 26:47.566
Huh?

27:29.816 --> 27:31.527
I want to know how you got here.

27:38.825 --> 27:39.952
I can try.

28:03.058 --> 28:05.769
The next thing I remember
is waking up here

28:07.104 --> 28:08.188
at your cabin.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.568
I fear there are more coming.

28:18.782 --> 28:20.951
They shot you
with a tracking device.

28:23.579 --> 28:24.788
Not a real bullet.

28:28.667 --> 28:30.085
Do you want me to leave?

28:41.346 --> 28:42.472
Not anymore.

28:45.184 --> 28:46.185
Thank you.

28:49.521 --> 28:51.273
They said you were infected.

28:54.568 --> 28:55.944
But you have no symptoms.

28:59.823 --> 29:00.991
It's a long story.

29:03.285 --> 29:05.078
They won't give up, they're just...

29:05.412 --> 29:06.538
They...

29:10.125 --> 29:14.296
These people, the ones
that's after you

29:16.256 --> 29:17.549
they killed my wife.

29:22.930 --> 29:23.972
John.

29:26.058 --> 29:27.226
You chose this.

29:31.355 --> 29:32.397
I'm sorry.

29:36.485 --> 29:37.903
You'll be safe here.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.499
Come in.

30:33.000 --> 30:33.959
Come out.

30:34.168 --> 30:36.420
Hey, how did you become so tall?

30:38.255 --> 30:39.548
Your favourite cake.

30:48.140 --> 30:49.558
Easy on the sugar, babe.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.018
It's supposed to be sweet.

30:55.731 --> 30:57.858
The only sugar I need is you.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.278
The romantic mechanic.

31:04.156 --> 31:05.157
How's the yard?

31:05.449 --> 31:06.909
Why do you think I came here?

31:08.577 --> 31:10.704
I told you you have
to build the fence yourself.

31:10.787 --> 31:11.955
I'm done, silly.

31:12.039 --> 31:12.915
Fence, too?

31:12.998 --> 31:14.583
Materials arrive tomorrow.

31:15.459 --> 31:18.378
Don't worry, I'm not letting you
anywhere near it.

31:18.837 --> 31:20.088
I've seen your carpentry.

31:57.709 --> 31:58.919
Praying for peace?

32:02.339 --> 32:05.592
More will come,
and hell with them.

32:06.134 --> 32:07.469
You don't seem too worried.

32:11.056 --> 32:12.599
Fear is an illusion.

32:15.352 --> 32:16.562
This is very real.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.361
Pain is real, death is real.

32:26.655 --> 32:27.781
So is love, John.

32:29.199 --> 32:30.242
And life.

32:30.659 --> 32:33.412
Love ends, life ends.

32:37.457 --> 32:38.792
But death is forever.

33:59.790 --> 34:00.999
They found the cure.

34:07.047 --> 34:08.340
He wants to have it.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.266
It will change
the whole world, John.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.565
The one controlling the
vaccine controls the virus

34:25.649 --> 34:28.902
and the one
controlling virus controls life.

34:30.946 --> 34:34.824
The vaccine belongs to
the people, not one man.

34:37.369 --> 34:38.829
Why are you telling me this?

34:46.920 --> 34:48.672
Because I am the vaccine.

34:55.012 --> 34:56.179
It's in my blood.

35:00.976 --> 35:02.644
I don't want to give it to them.

35:04.438 --> 35:06.481
I want to give it to the people.

35:08.150 --> 35:09.276
It's my redemption.

35:13.238 --> 35:15.824
You just brought a lot
of problems to my cabin.

35:19.036 --> 35:20.913
There's going to be
a bloody mess.

35:25.501 --> 35:26.877
I need you to help me.

35:30.255 --> 35:31.131
You have to.

35:31.215 --> 35:32.341
I don't want this.

35:34.468 --> 35:35.427
Damn it.

35:37.262 --> 35:38.597
Do it for your wife!

35:41.517 --> 35:42.559
Do it for good.

35:43.685 --> 35:45.729
Help me to get my blood
to the people.

36:12.047 --> 36:13.257
It needs cleaning.

36:14.842 --> 36:15.759
What?

36:15.843 --> 36:16.969
The wound is fine.

36:17.761 --> 36:18.929
The gun.

36:31.733 --> 36:32.776
What's your story?

36:33.443 --> 36:35.320
I told you, I am the vaccine.

36:36.154 --> 36:39.032
Not that.
How you handle weapons.

36:44.079 --> 36:47.332
Orphaned as a teenager
after my parents died

36:48.876 --> 36:50.085
turned juvenile

36:52.629 --> 36:55.549
went from jacking ATMs...

36:59.136 --> 37:00.512
to an armed robbery.

37:04.308 --> 37:05.642
Got pretty good with that.

37:09.605 --> 37:11.231
Well, before I got caught.

37:12.900 --> 37:17.029
Sentenced 10 years in
a women's penitentiary.

37:19.573 --> 37:24.036
Survived the virus
as it swept through the pen.

37:27.915 --> 37:30.626
Then I was sent to the lab
for testing.

37:31.210 --> 37:32.669
All the rest you know already.

37:33.003 --> 37:34.171
A jailbird, huh?

37:35.881 --> 37:37.090
I figured as much.

37:41.178 --> 37:42.304
Is it that obvious?

37:47.935 --> 37:51.188
Barcode tattoos tend to
tell their own stories.

38:07.913 --> 38:09.248
You know the saying

38:09.748 --> 38:11.333
you shoot like a bank robber?

38:12.417 --> 38:14.127
I was trained not to kill.

38:15.504 --> 38:16.672
Can't kill a can.

38:16.755 --> 38:17.714
I can.

38:18.757 --> 38:19.800
Go ahead.

38:21.301 --> 38:22.761
But what if it's a hostage?

38:31.019 --> 38:32.396
No one is innocent.

38:48.495 --> 38:49.746
No one is innocent.

39:10.517 --> 39:15.272
Legend has it a mighty
timber man lives in these woods.

39:17.149 --> 39:18.859
He kills the enemies of nature

39:19.610 --> 39:21.486
and he himself cannot be killed.

39:23.238 --> 39:25.991
He was born from
the ashes of a forest fire

39:26.992 --> 39:28.368
where 100 people died.

39:30.370 --> 39:32.164
And he eats babies
for breakfast.

39:38.003 --> 39:40.589
I can smell the shit in
your pants from here, boys.

39:40.714 --> 39:42.841
The look in your eyes,
priceless.

39:43.759 --> 39:45.052
That's not funny.

39:45.969 --> 39:47.179
Target in sight.

39:47.471 --> 39:48.555
Call for backup?

39:48.639 --> 39:49.598
Negative.

39:49.681 --> 39:51.350
We split the bounty three ways.

39:51.892 --> 39:53.727
Since when are we
fucking bounty hunters?

39:54.394 --> 39:56.688
Since there was
a prize put on the girl's arse.

39:57.231 --> 39:58.357
Focus, guys.

40:01.485 --> 40:05.030
Kill the logger
and bring the girl.

40:07.032 --> 40:08.033
Easy.

40:18.585 --> 40:19.795
Nature calls.

40:20.671 --> 40:21.713
Stay alert.

41:12.598 --> 41:14.349
Time to say goodnight,
Boogeyman.

41:19.980 --> 41:20.981
Goodnight.

41:34.161 --> 41:35.204
Easy.

41:35.787 --> 41:36.747
Easy!

41:37.080 --> 41:38.165
Easy.

41:43.504 --> 41:44.922
I'll kill the girl

41:47.216 --> 41:48.675
if you don't let me leave
with her.

42:21.333 --> 42:22.793
I don't negotiate.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.776
There's only one road
leading to this cabin.

42:49.194 --> 42:53.156
We got 30 minutes before
the dogs arrive, bloodthirsty.

43:05.502 --> 43:06.879
Get your weapons
and your gear.

43:06.962 --> 43:08.172
Sir, yes, sir!

43:08.797 --> 43:10.048
Up and out! Look alive!

43:13.719 --> 43:14.970
Move it! Move it! Move it!

43:21.268 --> 43:23.145
Do we have a plan
how to stop them?

43:30.194 --> 43:32.654
I think we can hold
'em off until winter.

43:35.699 --> 43:38.744
But after that,
a little bit harder, but doable.

44:06.730 --> 44:07.814
Time is ticking.

44:13.987 --> 44:17.032
I used to play with
these when I was a kid.

44:20.536 --> 44:22.162
This won't be no play time.

44:23.872 --> 44:24.831
Good.

44:28.377 --> 44:30.003
Cos I ain't no kid no more.

45:54.421 --> 45:55.339
Hey, John?

45:57.925 --> 45:59.843
You're one bad motherfucker.

46:02.596 --> 46:03.639
Sure I am.

46:07.017 --> 46:10.187
Grab some water, things
are going to burn tonight.

46:53.897 --> 46:55.065
Yep, it's her.

47:14.751 --> 47:17.713
<i>Commander Stone, the target</i>

47:17.796 --> 47:19.923
<i>is finally in our hands.</i>

48:48.303 --> 48:51.348
I told you to bring water,
not mercenaries.

48:54.476 --> 48:55.477
Hm!

49:13.829 --> 49:15.080
We are under attack.

49:15.497 --> 49:18.000
The girl has escaped,
send backup.

49:18.083 --> 49:19.835
It can't be that hard,
you morons.

49:19.960 --> 49:22.880
He lives by a lake in
a small fucking cabin

49:23.255 --> 49:24.506
and chops wood.

49:25.340 --> 49:27.676
<i>Find that timber man, now!</i>

49:29.469 --> 49:31.680
<i>The fellow living here
is helping her.</i>

49:31.847 --> 49:36.143
Listen, Timberlake is
going down, not the girl.

49:36.768 --> 49:38.604
I repeat, not the girl.

49:39.021 --> 49:41.732
You harm one hair
on her precious skull

49:42.149 --> 49:43.734
<i>and you're as dead as him.</i>

49:44.484 --> 49:45.444
<i>Got that?</i>

50:09.259 --> 50:11.220
I have orders not to kill you

50:12.054 --> 50:14.181
but I can and will hurt you.

50:15.182 --> 50:16.099
Bad.

50:24.775 --> 50:26.610
Ciao, <i>bella.</i>

50:31.532 --> 50:33.158
Kill the timber man
whatever the cost

50:33.242 --> 50:34.952
and me bring back
my golden cargo.

50:35.661 --> 50:37.788
I want a coordinated
siege of the cabin.

50:38.205 --> 50:40.207
Block all roads,
seal all entrances

50:40.749 --> 50:43.126
and attack in small units
from all angles.

50:44.211 --> 50:47.089
The girl can under
no circumstances get away.

50:47.339 --> 50:48.799
There shall
be no escape routes.

50:54.263 --> 50:56.223
We're half a click from target location.

50:56.306 --> 50:57.641
Approaching from the south.

51:40.767 --> 51:42.060
Is it really just one man?

51:42.561 --> 51:44.771
Seems like
a special forces soldier to me.

51:44.855 --> 51:46.481
The efficiency,
the way he kills.

51:46.648 --> 51:47.691
Then why the axe?

51:48.025 --> 51:48.942
Fuck knows.

51:49.234 --> 51:51.028
Probably wants
to make it personal.

52:34.696 --> 52:35.864
OK, hold.

53:20.033 --> 53:21.326
Fuck.

53:52.024 --> 53:55.068
We need to clean up
all this mess before supper.

53:56.403 --> 53:57.404
Huh?

53:58.906 --> 54:00.073
What's the point?

54:01.992 --> 54:03.619
Not finding your dead comrades

54:04.286 --> 54:05.829
is worse than finding them dead.

54:23.889 --> 54:25.015
How many have we lost?

54:25.390 --> 54:26.558
Awaiting confirmation.

54:27.184 --> 54:29.186
Awaiting confirmation?

54:29.686 --> 54:31.396
My empire is crumbling!

54:32.231 --> 54:33.482
Find out now!

54:35.859 --> 54:37.861
<i>We've lost comms with Delta Team.</i>

54:37.986 --> 54:40.447
<i>Find out what happened to them,
and stay alert.</i>

54:54.545 --> 54:55.629
Granite.

54:56.046 --> 54:57.005
Come in, over.

54:57.089 --> 54:58.090
Listening.

54:58.465 --> 55:02.094
There's a tunnel,
an underpass under the cabin.

55:02.678 --> 55:04.555
What do you mean?
They're all dead?

55:05.138 --> 55:06.181
<i>Where does it lead?</i>

55:06.265 --> 55:07.307
Straight to hell.

55:15.399 --> 55:16.483
Good job.

55:17.150 --> 55:18.151
Thanks.

55:20.028 --> 55:21.989
Hey! Where are you going?

55:23.115 --> 55:24.199
Hunting.

55:37.713 --> 55:38.755
Come in.

55:39.339 --> 55:40.340
Over.

55:42.050 --> 55:43.135
Fuck.

55:44.261 --> 55:45.387
It's an old mineshaft.

55:49.183 --> 55:50.225
A tunnel system.

55:51.268 --> 55:52.477
Do we know where it leads?

55:52.853 --> 55:53.854
We do now.

55:57.399 --> 55:58.859
Prepare for all scenarios.

56:00.027 --> 56:01.653
Tunnel extraction on the cargo.

56:02.821 --> 56:04.781
And should
that timber man slip inside

56:05.115 --> 56:07.201
you take a small group
and you flush him out.

56:08.076 --> 56:10.704
And I will make sure
he gets a very special

56:10.996 --> 56:12.789
warm welcome
on the other end.

56:18.921 --> 56:20.130
Target approaching.

56:27.513 --> 56:29.014
â€“

57:09.805 --> 57:11.431
Well, well, well.

57:12.349 --> 57:15.894
So, this is where you've been
hiding all these years, huh?

57:17.563 --> 57:18.647
Huh?

57:38.166 --> 57:39.126
C'mon!

58:14.661 --> 58:15.746
Stop!

58:16.371 --> 58:17.414
Drop it.

58:20.417 --> 58:21.668
Get your hands in the air.

59:19.351 --> 59:21.103
<i>I have eyes on the package.</i>

59:21.186 --> 59:23.397
<i>West side of the cabin,
by the waterfront.</i>

59:37.160 --> 59:38.328
Freeze!

01:00:39.431 --> 01:00:40.557
Target acquired.

01:00:41.266 --> 01:00:42.309
Going underground.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.812
Rendezvous coordinates, 057.

01:00:47.272 --> 01:00:48.774
<i>Copy that, Feltspat.</i>

01:00:48.857 --> 01:00:50.317
<i>We're en route
to that location.</i>

01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:51.944
<i>Keep the cargo safe.</i>

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:58.700
And you guys will never
believe who our timber man is.

01:00:58.951 --> 01:01:00.077
<i>Come in, Feltspat.</i>

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.370
Our timber man...

01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:02.496
<i>Repeat?</i>

01:01:02.579 --> 01:01:04.414
Is John Wood.

01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:07.501
John.

01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:10.003
Come in.

01:01:17.135 --> 01:01:19.054
<i>The good doctor
is out of radio reach</i>

01:01:19.137 --> 01:01:20.472
<i>but has acquired the target.</i>

01:01:20.556 --> 01:01:23.308
<i>Rendezvous at the coordinated
pickup site for surface extraction.</i>

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:48.709
Gentlemen.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.670
Yesterday,
you were all lost sheep

01:01:52.296 --> 01:01:53.255
and today

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:57.426
we rejoice towards
the future as shepherds.

01:01:57.968 --> 01:02:00.012
They say one man
cannot rule the world

01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:03.056
but with an army of leaders

01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:06.643
this desolate landscape
we now call the world

01:02:06.894 --> 01:02:08.187
shall be rebuilt again

01:02:09.188 --> 01:02:12.566
in an image
of impenetrable rule of furious...

01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:13.567
Sir.

01:02:13.984 --> 01:02:15.194
Sir, sir.

01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:17.362
Feltspat wasn't there.

01:02:17.696 --> 01:02:18.739
And neither was the cargo.

01:02:50.604 --> 01:02:54.107
Three, five.

01:02:55.526 --> 01:02:56.985
I should be here.

01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:59.029
I am here...

01:03:04.618 --> 01:03:05.869
Oh, shit.

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:07.496
Shit.

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:14.044
Good to see you again, Doctor.

01:03:19.716 --> 01:03:20.801
You.

01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:28.392
You really need to learn
how to die.

01:04:20.652 --> 01:04:21.778
Reinforcements.

01:04:22.738 --> 01:04:23.739
Send 'em in.

01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:26.783
Get him, flush him out, kill him

01:04:27.075 --> 01:04:28.535
and get the fucking girl.

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.204
Now! Let's go.

01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:31.246
How many?

01:04:34.499 --> 01:04:35.626
All of them!

01:05:49.157 --> 01:05:51.034
You need to learn how to kill.

01:05:58.834 --> 01:05:59.835
John.

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:02.004
John.

01:06:19.021 --> 01:06:20.063
Fan out!

01:06:20.272 --> 01:06:22.941
- Go around the ladder.
- Go, go, go, watch his back!

01:06:28.405 --> 01:06:29.489
Two minutes.

01:06:30.866 --> 01:06:33.035
That will be the two
last minutes of your life.

01:06:34.786 --> 01:06:35.787
They're catching up.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.498
It's like an infinite supply.

01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:40.876
They're like cockroaches.

01:06:41.585 --> 01:06:43.462
That's why the world
made exterminators.

01:06:59.853 --> 01:07:01.188
<i>Shots fired, shots fired.</i>

01:07:01.271 --> 01:07:02.814
- <i>They're heading for the...</i>
- Got the target!

01:07:02.898 --> 01:07:04.024
Put 'em down!

01:07:06.318 --> 01:07:08.612
- Secure the exits!
- Move out of the way!

01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:15.494
Move, move, move!

01:07:15.744 --> 01:07:17.037
Get down!
Take cover!

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:27.840
Down! Back up, back up!

01:08:18.974 --> 01:08:20.975
I'm out, reloading.

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:32.321
Get ready.

01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:53.759
Behind you!

01:09:00.474 --> 01:09:01.600
Take the shield.

01:09:04.435 --> 01:09:05.770
We've got to get out of here.

01:09:19.493 --> 01:09:21.370
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:24.957
Stay close, stay close.

01:09:43.559 --> 01:09:45.602
Move. Go, go, go, go!

01:09:47.938 --> 01:09:49.564
John?

01:09:52.484 --> 01:09:53.443
Go, go.

01:09:58.657 --> 01:09:59.783
Keep moving.

01:10:02.953 --> 01:10:04.329
Go, go, go!

01:10:29.438 --> 01:10:30.439
Stop.

01:10:31.064 --> 01:10:32.107
Get in here.

01:11:03.889 --> 01:11:05.057
Boys, come on. Move!

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.975
- Go, go, go!
- This way!

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.227
Stay here.

01:11:10.103 --> 01:11:11.188
No.

01:11:17.694 --> 01:11:18.946
You need to trust me.

01:11:19.738 --> 01:11:20.822
There's no time.

01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:24.117
No, I don't want to lose you.

01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:28.205
Life is nothing but lies.

01:11:32.918 --> 01:11:34.419
All we can do is live.

01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:39.049
I don't want to live
without you.

01:11:43.804 --> 01:11:44.888
You will.

01:14:16.123 --> 01:14:19.251
John Wood, what a surprise.

01:14:20.836 --> 01:14:23.630
Our dear timber man
is John Wood.

01:14:24.882 --> 01:14:28.218
The defector
who escaped his sentence.

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:33.056
Now I know why this woodpecker
was such a pain in the ass.

01:14:33.849 --> 01:14:35.142
It was John Wood.

01:14:36.059 --> 01:14:37.227
Welcome home.

01:14:37.728 --> 01:14:39.771
Nuh-uh-uh-uh, don't kill him.

01:14:40.564 --> 01:14:41.732
Not just yet.

01:14:42.441 --> 01:14:43.609
He's an old friend.

01:14:53.785 --> 01:14:54.828
Friend?

01:14:56.079 --> 01:14:58.290
Is that what you call family
these days?

01:14:58.582 --> 01:15:00.083
Ah, yes.

01:15:01.126 --> 01:15:02.169
Friend.

01:15:02.836 --> 01:15:06.381
That's as close
as you will ever get again

01:15:07.007 --> 01:15:08.926
my dear... brother.

01:15:12.262 --> 01:15:14.223
And you should be honoured
by that notion.

01:15:15.724 --> 01:15:17.059
You can change your name

01:15:18.727 --> 01:15:20.562
but you can never change
your blood.

01:15:21.647 --> 01:15:22.689
Wood.

01:15:25.484 --> 01:15:27.819
I always thought
that sounded too soft.

01:15:27.903 --> 01:15:30.864
My name's Stone.
Commander Stone.

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:33.825
Besides, Father always
favoured you.

01:15:34.034 --> 01:15:35.452
His favourite woodsman.

01:15:36.119 --> 01:15:37.579
But he's not here now, is he?

01:15:37.704 --> 01:15:40.040
To save your ass from
another beating this time.

01:15:41.542 --> 01:15:45.170
And actually,
you can change your blood.

01:15:46.213 --> 01:15:47.965
That's the whole reason
why we're here.

01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:50.634
The girl!

01:15:50.968 --> 01:15:51.927
Where is she?

01:15:55.931 --> 01:15:59.226
The girl, John. Hand her over.

01:16:02.604 --> 01:16:03.647
I killed her.

01:16:05.065 --> 01:16:07.442
There were two things
you were never really good at.

01:16:08.902 --> 01:16:11.780
Killing innocents and lying.

01:16:12.447 --> 01:16:13.490
Where is she?

01:16:17.536 --> 01:16:18.662
I killed her.

01:16:20.122 --> 01:16:22.124
We can't find her, she's gone.

01:16:23.542 --> 01:16:25.419
Then she's missing, not dead.

01:16:26.044 --> 01:16:28.255
And I'm pretty sure
she's around here somewhere.

01:16:28.463 --> 01:16:30.757
So, please,
with some conviction here

01:16:30.883 --> 01:16:34.845
my dear brother
will tell us exactly where she is.

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:38.390
Guys, beatdown time.

01:17:22.601 --> 01:17:23.894
This can be easy, John.

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:27.189
It doesn't have to be
high school all over again.

01:17:38.283 --> 01:17:39.284
Enough!

01:17:44.122 --> 01:17:45.499
Had enough, tough guy?

01:17:52.339 --> 01:17:53.757
Are you ready to speak now?

01:17:54.925 --> 01:17:55.884
Huh?

01:17:57.678 --> 01:17:59.137
You ready to talk to me, John?

01:18:00.305 --> 01:18:01.348
John?

01:18:05.644 --> 01:18:06.770
She's dead.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.439
Gone.

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:35.549
For fuck's sake!

01:18:37.301 --> 01:18:38.510
This is pointless.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:46.018
Kill him.

01:18:47.728 --> 01:18:48.812
Coward!

01:19:03.035 --> 01:19:06.830
Are you afraid of
a half-dead man?

01:19:22.387 --> 01:19:24.723
Last man down,
you and me!

01:19:28.393 --> 01:19:32.022
Oh boy, we're really back in
high school again, aren't we?

01:19:32.606 --> 01:19:33.899
You really want to do this?

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.321
You and me.

01:20:02.761 --> 01:20:03.720
Come on!

01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:19.236
You never knew
when to quit, little brother.

01:20:20.571 --> 01:20:21.572
Did you?

01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:25.242
Always wanting to impress,
always struggling to catch up.

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:27.703
But guess what?

01:20:28.871 --> 01:20:30.163
Today, you did catch up.

01:20:31.582 --> 01:20:32.958
Catch up to your own death.

01:20:34.459 --> 01:20:37.129
But you've been dead to me
for many years.

01:20:38.672 --> 01:20:42.342
But it's about time
that you join your wife in hell.

01:21:04.615 --> 01:21:05.782
Give me a gun.

01:21:05.991 --> 01:21:07.242
Give me the fucking gun!

01:21:14.333 --> 01:21:16.418
John, turn around.

01:21:17.836 --> 01:21:18.921
Turn around!

01:21:23.509 --> 01:21:24.510
Turn around.

01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:43.111
You chose this.

01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:30.576
I was planning
to do that myself.

01:22:32.369 --> 01:22:34.246
Thank you for saving me
the trouble.

01:22:35.497 --> 01:22:36.874
Go fuck yourself.

01:22:37.207 --> 01:22:39.334
You're the only one
getting fucked around here.

01:22:39.793 --> 01:22:40.878
Stop!

01:22:46.008 --> 01:22:48.177
Back away from him,
you assholes.

01:22:48.886 --> 01:22:52.347
Or you will be wearing my bloody
antidote to your own funerals!

01:22:53.724 --> 01:22:54.641
No.

01:22:54.725 --> 01:22:55.726
I'll come with you...

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:00.522
but you let him live.

01:23:03.066 --> 01:23:04.026
Don't.

01:23:05.277 --> 01:23:06.236
Good girl.

01:23:07.946 --> 01:23:09.072
Take her to the chopper.

01:23:09.156 --> 01:23:10.324
Yes, ma'am.

01:23:44.483 --> 01:23:45.651
I'll find you.

01:23:46.735 --> 01:23:48.654
The new blood of the future
has arrived.

01:23:49.613 --> 01:23:50.697
Hello.

01:23:52.074 --> 01:23:54.952
Sovereignty is never given.

01:23:55.786 --> 01:23:58.163
It is claimed. Taken.

01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:05.003
We must let go of the old
and embrace the new.

01:24:05.587 --> 01:24:09.758
The children of yesterday will
adapt to the revised constitution.

01:24:10.592 --> 01:24:13.720
These laws will be
governed by the select few.

01:24:15.055 --> 01:24:16.056
Mainly us.

01:24:17.099 --> 01:24:20.853
Spring has a way of
welcoming all of us

01:24:21.645 --> 01:24:23.605
but only the fittest
survive the winter.

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:28.151
To the north.

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.946
The new dawn.

01:24:31.613 --> 01:24:32.865
The beginning of a new era...

01:24:34.324 --> 01:24:35.742
that is ready to greet you.

01:25:09.234 --> 01:25:10.485
<i>Dear John</i>

01:25:10.652 --> 01:25:12.029
<i>if anything happens to me</i>

01:25:12.237 --> 01:25:15.824
<i>you will find three vials of my blood
in your fridge.</i>

01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:22.456
<i>Promise to give my blood,
the antidote, to the people.</i>

01:25:23.874 --> 01:25:25.876
<i>That is my last and only wish.</i>

01:25:27.002 --> 01:25:28.420
<i>Yours, Maria.</i>
